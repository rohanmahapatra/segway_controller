Segway Tests

- Make sure integral term in balance_cntrl gets reset when pwr_up is asserted
    - From BadBehaviorSegway.mp4

A2D Converter
    - Batt
        - Tested as part of the piezo driver
    - Cells
        - Check that the load cell values assert/deassert rider_off

Piezo
    - Check that low value causes batt_low to assert
        - low_batt threshold is 0x800
    - Check that batt_low and ovr_spd can occur at same time
    - moving "normal mode" should occur once every 2 seconds
	

Don't look at specific mtr_drv values, but check direction and speed to get a sense of what is going on.
